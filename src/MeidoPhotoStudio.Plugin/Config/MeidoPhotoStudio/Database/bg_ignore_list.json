/*
    This file is included as a convenience to prevent C(O)M3D2 BGs from being added to the 'Props 1' dropdown

    You should consider checking your 'phot_bg_list_add.nei' file in the 'PhotoBG_NEI' folder somewhere in your 'Mod'
    folder to see if you're missing any of these items and add them. This will have the added benefit of having these
    BGs show up in the backgrounds dropdown and in studio mode.
