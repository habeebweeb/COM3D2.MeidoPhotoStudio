== 1.0.0-beta.4.1

* IK drag handles for the arms and fingers match body node position rather than bone position so drag handles are no
longer offset from maid body

=== Fixes

* Fix message box and text disappearing after leaving edit mode
* Fix background switcher breaking when `MyRoom` directory is missing from game root
* Fix blur effect not turning off properly
* Fix issue where loading a scene that uses a non-existent pose breaks the pose selector

hooks
